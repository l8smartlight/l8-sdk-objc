http://www.l8smartlight.com/sdk/

You'll see 2 modules, each of them has its corresponding target:
L8-sdk-objc: SDK code for Objective-C. Generate libl8-sdk-objc.a.
L8SDKTest: example of a minimal application for iPhone using the SDK, with small samples of SDK invocations. Generate L8SDKTest.app.
To create the SDK's library, choose the target: lib-sdk-objc and the destination: iOS Device. In Products, the file: libl8-sdk-objc.a is generated. Right click over it and choose > Show in Finder, there you can find the file.
By default it's compiled in DEBUG mode.

There is a list of available methods can be found, and furthermore there are several sample codes commented, to show you simple uses of the available methods so far.
